<?php echo "Hello, I'm Ahmed Doreno" ?>

👋 Hey there! As a Back-End Developer, I've got a serious passion for all things PHP. But that's not all – I thrive on crafting native solutions and steering clear of the ordinary. Frameworks? Nah, I'd rather roll up my sleeves and get hands-on!

After a brief hiatus from the coding cosmos, I'm back and raring to go. My projects might not be sprawling across the digital realm just yet, but hey, that's what this moment is all about, right? It's time to revamp, reimagine, and rebuild.

What I Excel At..
Languages: PHP (OOP), MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Front-End: jQuery, Bootstrap
Back-End: Creating dynamic server-side logic, managing databases

Here's the Scoop..
- PHP Enthusiast: PHP isn't just code for me ❤❤ it's a creative journey that never gets old 💪.
- Native is Nifty: While frameworks have their charms, I'm all about that raw, native magic.
- Dreams to Reality: If you can dream it, I can build it. Turning concepts into digital wonders is my thing.
- Back to Basics: I'm returning to the coding game after a bit of a break, and the excitement is palpable.
